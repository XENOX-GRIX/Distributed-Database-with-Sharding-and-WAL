# Replicated Database with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)

## Introduction

This project implements a sharded database system that ensures data consistency across replicated shards using a Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism. This approach helps maintain a consistent state in the event of unexpected shutdowns by logging changes before applying them to the database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker version 20.10.23 or above
- Python (preferable), C++, or Java
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or above

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-directory
   ```
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-docker-image .
   ```
4. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 your-docker-image
   ```

## Usage

To start the system, execute the Docker container which will initiate the database and start the Flask application. The system is then ready to handle API requests to manage data entries.

## Features

- **Sharded Database**: Distributes data across several shards, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **Write-Ahead Logging**: Ensures data integrity by logging changes before they are committed to the database.
- **Replication**: Maintains copies of data across different servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Recovery**: Supports system recovery by restoring the database to a consistent state using the WAL files.

## Dependencies

List all necessary dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, and install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Configuration details such as database connection settings are managed in the Docker configuration files and environment variables.

## Documentation

Refer to the inline comments within the code for detailed explanations of the functionality and architecture. The project also includes system diagrams and a detailed explanation of the WAL mechanism.

## Examples

Here are some examples of API calls that can be made to the system:

- **Add Entry**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST localhost:5000/add -d '{"shard":"sh1", "data":{"Stud_id":123, "Stud_name":"John Doe", "Stud_marks":88}}'
  ```

- **Update Entry**:
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT localhost:5000/update -d '{"shard":"sh2", "Stud_id":123, "data":{"Stud_marks":90}}'
  ```

- **Delete Entry**:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/delete -d '{"shard":"sh3", "Stud_id":123}'
  ```

## Troubleshooting

For common issues such as connection errors or data consistency problems, ensure that Docker is configured correctly and that all environment variables are set properly. Refer to the Docker logs for detailed error reports.
